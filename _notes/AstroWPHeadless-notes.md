# AstroWPHeadless notes
- Project to test headless communication from Wordpress to Astro using 
  - REST API
  - GraphQL

# Goals:
- [v] connect Astro to WP through GET calls
- [v] process JSON data
- [v] properly parse the content in the JSON and render it to a page
- handle pagination
- properly handle additional query params

- create pages dynamically using API fetching
  - [slug].astro 
- 

- repeat the above with WPGraphQL
- render the data to the page
